# Bitwise-Operators
A C program that will implement a set of operations supported by a menu that will prompt for the operation (“Count Leading Zeros”, “Endian Swap”, “Rotate Right”, and “Parity”) along with an unsigned 32-bit number, and then perform that operation on the input integer to produce the result. 

To compile, type "make" without the quotations. This will create an executable name "major". To execute, type "./major1" without the quotes then just follow the menu prompts for testing.

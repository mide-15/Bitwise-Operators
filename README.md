# Bitwise-Operators
A C program that will implement a set of operations supported by a menu that will prompt for the operation (“Count Leading Zeros”, “Endian Swap”, “Rotate Right”, and “Parity”) along with an unsigned 32-bit number, and then perform that operation on the input integer to produce the result.
